# Food_Delivery_Cost_and_Profitability_Analysis

## Project Overview

A food delivery service is facing challenges in achieving profitability across its operations. With a dataset of 1,000 food orders, the service seeks to understand the dynamics of its cost structure and profitability to identify strategic opportunities for improvement.

## Data Set

The dataset contains comprehensive details on food orders, including:
- Order ID
- Customer ID
- Restaurant ID
- Order and Delivery Date and Time
- Order Value
- Delivery Fee
- Payment Method
- Discounts and Offers
- Commission Fee
- Payment Processing Fee
- Refunds/Chargebacks

This data provides a foundation for analyzing the cost structure and profitability of the food delivery service.

## Problem Statement

1. **Detailed Cost Analysis:** Identify major cost components associated with delivering food orders, including both direct costs (such as delivery fees) and indirect costs (such as discounts and payment processing fees).

2. **Profitability Evaluation:** Calculate the profitability of individual orders and aggregate this data to assess overall profitability. Evaluate how revenue from commission fees compares to total costs.

3. **Strategic Recommendations for Improvement:** Develop actionable strategies to reduce costs and adjust pricing, commission fees, and discount strategies to improve profitability. Identify an optimal balance for commission and discount percentages to ensure profitability.

4. **Impact Simulation of Proposed Strategies:** Simulate the financial impact of recommended strategies on profitability. Forecast how changes in commission rates and discount strategies could potentially transform current losses into profits.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gather comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.
4. **Cost Breakdown:** Analyze costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees, payment processing fee, and discounts).
5. **Revenue Determination:** Calculate revenue from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
6. **Profit Calculation:** Determine profit for each order by subtracting total costs from revenue. Analyze profitability distribution to identify trends.
7. **Strategic Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, develop recommendations to enhance profitability.
8. **Simulation:** Use data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.

## Conclusion and Insights

### Key Metrics
- **Total Orders:** 1,000
- **Total Revenue:** ₹126,990
- **Total Costs:** ₹132,741.85
- **Total Profit:** -₹5,751.85

The analysis reveals that total costs exceed revenue from commission fees, resulting in a net loss. This suggests that current commission rates, delivery fees, and discount strategies may not be sustainable for profitability.

### Visualization Insights
- **Profit Distribution:** There is a wide range of profit per order, with many orders resulting in a loss. The average profit is negative, highlighting the overall loss-making situation.
- **Cost Breakdown:** The pie chart indicates that Discount Amount constitutes a significant portion of costs, suggesting that promotional strategies may be heavily impacting overall profitability.
- **Revenue vs. Costs:** The visualization shows that costs surpass revenue, leading to a total loss.

### Recommendations
- **New Average Commission Percentage:** 27.70%
- **New Average Discount Percentage:** 5.62%

Analysis of profitable orders indicates that a higher commission rate and lower discount percentage are associated with profitability. Adjusting to these new percentages could improve overall profitability.

### Simulated Impact
- **Total Orders Simulated:** 1,000
- **Total Revenue Simulated:** ₹295,111.32
- **Total Costs Simulated:** ₹121,690.14
- **Total Profit Simulated:** ₹173,421.18

The simulated scenario shows a significant shift towards increased profitability per order with the recommended commission and discount rates. This suggests that the proposed adjustments may lead to a higher percentage of profitable orders.
